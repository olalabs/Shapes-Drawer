## General info 
The program allows to draw basic geometric shapes (a straight line from point to point, a rectangle between two points, points - free drawing mode). Drawn objects are visible during the drawing. You can choose a color (from several predefined) and the type of shape currently drawn.
For individual shapes, there are definied classes describing their behavior e.g. on mouse cursor movement, pressing, releasing the mouse button (using polymorphism in form.cs).
The interface for drawing is in the form of tabs with subsequent drawings. You can close, move, maximize and minimize the window. The content of the tabs can be saved to and loaded from a file. Tabs can be closed and new ones opened. After closing the last tab, the program exits.
